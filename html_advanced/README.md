# HTML Advanced Project

Welcome to the "HTML Advanced" project! In this project, our goal is to implement a web page from scratch based entirely on a design file provided by a designer. The key focus here is on HTML structure, emphasizing semantic HTML. This project is a great opportunity to practice and demonstrate the ability to convert design into a well-structured HTML document.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to accurately translate a designer's vision into a functional HTML document. We are focusing solely on the HTML structure - no CSS or inline styles will be applied. This approach will help us concentrate on the semantic elements of HTML, ensuring that the content is organized logically and is accessible.

## Design File

The design file for this project is available on Figma. You can view and interact with the design using the following link:

## Project Structure


Here's the suggested structure for this HTML document:

-   **Header:** Navigation and introductory content.
-   **Main Section:** Core content of the page.
-   **Aside:** Supplementary content if present in the design.
-   **Footer:** Footer and closing information.
